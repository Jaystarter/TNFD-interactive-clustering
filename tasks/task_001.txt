# Task ID: 1
# Title: Redesign Node Click Popup
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Modify the existing node click popup to be smaller, display the tool's description, and visually match the provided example image. The popup should include the tool's name (title), primary function, data sources (as chips), and links to other tools (as chips/text).
# Details:
1. Locate Existing Popup: Identify the React component and logic for the current popup (likely in App.tsx or child, triggered by relationshipInfo state). 2. Data Mapping: Map Tool.name to title; find a suitable Tool.description field; map Tool.primaryFunction; map Tool.dataSources (array) to MUI Chips; map Tool.linksTo (array) to MUI Chips with '+N more' logic. 3. Component Structure & Styling: Use MUI Paper, Box, Typography, Chip. Ensure it's 'way smaller'. Mimic example image layout. 4. Functionality: Retain existing show/hide logic on node click/click away.

# Test Strategy:
Click various nodes. Verify correct info display (name, description, primary function, data sources, links). Confirm smaller size and visual match. Test with varying data quantities.
