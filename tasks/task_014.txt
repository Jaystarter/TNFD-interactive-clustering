# Task ID: 14
# Title: Design and Implement UI Structure for TNFD Tools Relational Map with ShadCN/Tailwind
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a comprehensive UI architecture and component structure for the TNFD Tools Relational Map application using ShadCN and Tailwind CSS, replacing the previous MUI implementation.
# Details:
Design and implement the complete UI structure for the TNFD Tools Relational Map application following these requirements:

1. **Component Architecture**:
   - Create a component hierarchy diagram showing parent-child relationships
   - Define reusable components vs. page-specific components
   - Document component props and state management approach

2. **UI Sections to Implement**:
   - **Header**: Application title, TNFD branding, navigation controls
   - **Search Bar**: Input with AI/natural language search indication and visual feedback
   - **Filter Panel**: Implement filter controls for categories, functions, environments, data sources, and users
   - **Main Visualization Area**: Container for the force-directed graph with appropriate sizing and responsiveness
   - **Tool Details Panel**: Sidebar or modal design for displaying detailed information
   - **Responsive Layout**: Ensure proper display across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

3. **Technical Implementation**:
   - Set up ShadCN component library with Tailwind CSS
   - Create a consistent theming system with color variables, spacing, and typography
   - Implement responsive breakpoints and layout strategies
   - Ensure accessibility compliance (WCAG AA standards)
   - Document component usage patterns for future development

4. **Migration Strategy**:
   - Identify MUI components to be replaced and their ShadCN equivalents
   - Create a phased migration plan for incremental implementation
   - Ensure visual consistency during transition period

Deliver a Figma design or detailed wireframes along with the component implementation plan.

# Test Strategy:
The UI structure implementation should be verified through the following tests:

1. **Component Rendering Tests**:
   - Verify each component renders correctly in isolation using Storybook or similar tool
   - Test components with various prop combinations and states
   - Ensure components match design specifications

2. **Layout and Responsiveness Tests**:
   - Test the application at standard breakpoints (320px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px)
   - Verify that all UI elements adjust appropriately at each breakpoint
   - Confirm that content remains accessible and usable at all screen sizes

3. **Accessibility Testing**:
   - Run automated accessibility tests using tools like Axe or Lighthouse
   - Perform keyboard navigation testing through all interactive elements
   - Verify proper ARIA attributes and semantic HTML structure
   - Test with screen readers to ensure compatibility

4. **Visual Regression Testing**:
   - Capture screenshots of the current MUI implementation
   - Compare with new ShadCN/Tailwind implementation to ensure visual consistency
   - Document and justify any intentional visual changes

5. **User Testing**:
   - Conduct user testing sessions with 3-5 users to validate the new UI
   - Gather feedback on usability, clarity, and visual appeal
   - Document findings and implement necessary adjustments

All tests should be documented with results and any issues addressed before considering the task complete.
