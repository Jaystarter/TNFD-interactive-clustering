      "taskTitle": "Implement Dynamic Viewport Node Containment Logic",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of dynamic viewport node containment logic into subtasks covering zoom/pan constraints, node drag containment, viewport adjustment on resize, configurable padding, performance optimization, and comprehensive testing.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves complex interactive logic, real-time constraints, and performance optimization for smooth user experience. It requires handling multiple user interactions (zoom, pan, drag), dynamic resizing, and ensuring all nodes remain visible, which increases both cyclomatic and structural complexity[4][5]."

      "expansionPrompt": "Expand the search and filter functionality task into subtasks for keyword search, natural language integration (Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite), filter implementation, graph update logic, and API optimization/testing.",
      "reasoning": "Integrating both keyword and natural language search, along with dynamic filtering and real-time graph updates, introduces significant complexity in terms of logic, integration, and performance considerations[4][5]."

      "expansionPrompt": "Decompose the UI enhancement task into subtasks for implementing feature weight sliders, tooltips, UI animations/transitions, and accessibility/responsiveness checks.",
      "reasoning": "While UI enhancements are generally less complex than core logic, combining interactive controls, animations, and accessibility requirements increases the structural and maintainability complexity[4]."

      "reasoning": "Supporting multiple export formats and customizable, branded reports requires handling diverse technical challenges, file generation, and ensuring high-quality outputs, which raises both cyclomatic and structural complexity[4][5]."
