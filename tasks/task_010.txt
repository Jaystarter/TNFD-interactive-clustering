# Task ID: 10
# Title: Migrate Feedback Components and Implement Custom Components
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 8, 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Replace MUI Snackbar/Alert, Progress indicators, and implement any custom components needed.
# Details:
Replace Snackbar/Alert with ShadCN Toast. Implement ShadCN Progress component. Create custom components where ShadCN doesn't provide direct equivalents. Adapt specialized visualization components to work with ShadCN. Refactor any custom components that extend MUI components.

# Test Strategy:
Test toast notifications for proper display and dismissal. Verify progress indicators accurately reflect loading states. Test custom components against their original MUI counterparts. Ensure consistent behavior and appearance.
