# Task ID: 4
# Title: Migrate Typography System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Replace MUI Typography components with ShadCN typography components or appropriate Tailwind classes.
# Details:
Create typography components for different text styles (h1-h6, body, etc.). Implement consistent text styling using Tailwind classes. Create utility components for common text patterns. Ensure proper font loading. Document typography system with examples.

# Test Strategy:
Compare text rendering before and after migration. Verify that font sizes, weights, and styles match the original design. Test accessibility of text elements (contrast, scaling, etc.).
