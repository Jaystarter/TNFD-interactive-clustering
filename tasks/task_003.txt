# Task ID: 3
# Title: Migrate Core Layout Components
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Replace MUI Grid, Paper, Container, and Box components with ShadCN/Tailwind equivalents.
# Details:
Create ShadCN equivalents for Paper (using Card or custom component). Replace Grid with Tailwind's grid or flex utilities. Create container components using Tailwind's container utility. Implement spacing utilities to replace Box. Create a layout documentation with examples for consistent usage.

# Test Strategy:
Implement visual regression testing to compare layouts before and after migration. Test responsive behavior across different screen sizes. Verify that layouts maintain proper spacing and alignment.
