# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup ShadCN UI and Tailwind CSS Infrastructure
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Install and configure ShadCN UI, Tailwind CSS, and related dependencies. Set up the project structure to support incremental component migration.
# Details:
Install required packages: shadcn/ui, tailwindcss, postcss, autoprefixer. Configure tailwind.config.js with TNFD brand colors and design tokens. Set up the components.json file for ShadCN CLI. Create a directory structure for new components. Implement a strategy for coexistence of MUI and ShadCN during migration.

# Test Strategy:
Verify successful installation by creating a simple test component. Ensure Tailwind classes are properly processed. Confirm that existing MUI components still function correctly alongside the new setup.
